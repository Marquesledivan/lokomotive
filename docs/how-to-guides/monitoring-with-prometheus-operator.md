## Introduction

This guide provides the steps for deploying a monitoring stack using the `prometheus-operator` Lokomotive component and explains how to access Prometheus, Alertmanager and Grafana.

## Prerequisites

* A Lokomotive cluster deployed on a supported provider and accessible via `kubectl`.

<!---
TODO: Once we have tutorials on how to deploy and configure Rook or OpenEBS, point the following to those tutorials.
-->

* A storage provider component (`rook` and `rook-ceph`, or `openebs-operator` and `openebs-storage-class`) deployed with a default storage class that can provision volumes for the [PVCs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) created by Alertmanager and Prometheus.

<!---
TODO: Once we have a tutorial on how to deploy and configure Contour and cert-manager, point the following to that tutorial.
-->
> **NOTE**: If you wish to [expose Grafana to the public internet](#using-ingress), the following Lokomotive components should be installed:
> * [`metallb`](./ingress-with-contour-metallb.md) (only on Packet and bare-metal)
> * [`contour`](../configuration-reference/components/contour.md)
> * [`cert-manager`](../configuration-reference/components/cert-manager.md)


## Deploy Prometheus Operator

### Configure Prometheus Operator

Create a file named `monitoring.lokocfg` with the following contents:

```tf
component "prometheus-operator" {}
```

For information about all the available configuration options for the `prometheus-operator` component, visit the component's [configuration reference](../configuration-reference/components/prometheus-operator.md).

### Install Prometheus Operator

Execute the following command to deploy the `prometheus-operator` component:

```bash
lokoctl component apply prometheus-operator
```

Verify the pods in the `monitoring` namespace are in the `Running` state (this may take a few minutes):

```bash
kubectl -n monitoring get pods
```

## Accessing Prometheus, Alertmanager and Grafana

### Accessing Prometheus

#### Using port forward

Execute the following command to forward port `9090` locally to the Prometheus pod:

```bash
kubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/prometheus-operator-prometheus 9090
```

Open the following URL: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).

#### Using Ingress

**NOTE**: NOT RECOMMENDED IN PRODUCTION. Prometheus does not support any authentication out of the box, it has to be enabled at the Ingress layer which is not supported in Lokomotive Ingress at the moment. Therefore, adding following config exposes Prometheus to the outside world and anyone can access it.

To expose Prometheus to the internet using Ingress, provide the `host` field. The configuration for Prometheus in the `prometheus-operator` component should look like the following:

```tf
component "prometheus-operator" {
  prometheus {
    ingress {
      host = "prometheus.<cluster name>.<DNS zone>"
    }
  }
}
```

> **NOTE**: On Packet, you either need to create a DNS entry for `prometheus.<cluster name>.<DNS zone>` and point it to the Packet external IP for the contour service (see the [Packet ingress guide for more details](./ingress-with-contour-metallb.md)) or use the [External DNS component](../configuration-reference/components/external-dns.md).

Open the following URL: `https://prometheus.<cluster name>.<DNS zone>`.

### Accessing Alertmanager

Execute the following command to forward port `9093` locally to the Alertmanager pod:

```bash
kubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/prometheus-operator-alertmanager 9093
```

Open the following URL: [http://localhost:9093](http://localhost:9093).

### Accessing Grafana

#### Using port forward

Execute the following command to forward port `8080` locally to the Grafana dashboard pod on port `80`:

```bash
kubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/prometheus-operator-grafana 8080:80
```

Obtain the password for the `admin` Grafana user by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl -n monitoring get secret prometheus-operator-grafana -o jsonpath='{.data.admin-password}' | base64 -d && echo
```

Open the following URL: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Enter the username `admin` and password obtained from the previous step.

#### Using Ingress

To expose Grafana to the internet using Ingress, provide the host field. The configuration for Grafana in the `prometheus-operator` component should look like the following:

```tf
component "prometheus-operator" {
  grafana {
    ingress {
      host = "grafana.<cluster name>.<DNS zone>"
    }
  }
}
```

> **NOTE**: On Packet, you either need to create a DNS entry for `grafana.<cluster name>.<DNS zone>` and point it to the Packet external IP for the contour service (see the [Packet ingress guide for more details](./ingress-with-contour-metallb.md)) or use the [External DNS component](../configuration-reference/components/external-dns.md).

Obtain the password for the `admin` Grafana user by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl -n monitoring get secret prometheus-operator-grafana -o jsonpath='{.data.admin-password}' | base64 -d && echo
```

Open the following URL: `https://grafana.<cluster name>.<DNS zone>`. Enter the username `admin` and the password obtained from the previous step.
